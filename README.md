# Sales_Insights_Analysis_Dashboard

## 📈 Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance and profitability for a multi-channel business (Brick & Mortar and E-commerce). By transforming raw transactional data from 2017 to 2020 into interactive visualizations, the dashboard enables stakeholders to identify revenue drivers, track regional performance, and optimize profit margins.

## 📊 Key Insights & Metrics
* **Core KPI Tracking:** Monitored total **Revenue (₹142M)**, **Sales Quantity (350K)**, and **Total Profit Margin (₹2.1M)**.
* **Market Dominance:** Identified **Delhi NCR** as the primary revenue hub, contributing **54.7%** of total revenue.
* **Profitability Paradox:** Discovered that while Delhi leads in volume, regions like **Bhubaneshwar** exhibit higher relative profit percentages (**10.5%**), highlighting opportunities for operational efficiency.
* **Customer & Product Intelligence:** Isolated the **Top 5 Customers** (led by Electricalsara Stores at ₹66M) and **Top 5 Products** to understand brand loyalty and inventory demand.
* **Revenue Trends:** Visualized a significant downward trend in revenue toward the end of Q2 2020, providing a basis for market recovery analysis.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Tool:** Power BI Desktop.
* **Data Transformation:** **Power Query (ETL)** used to clean and handle multi-year datasets, including managing (Blank) entries and merging tables.
* **Data Modeling:** Built a robust model to compare current performance against historical data and profit targets.
* **Calculations:** Developed custom **DAX** measures for Profit Margin %, Revenue Contribution %, and Time Intelligence.

## 🖥️ Dashboard Features
* **Key Insights Page:** High-level summary of revenue, quantity, and market trends.
* **Profit Analysis:** Deep dive into profit contribution by market and customer type.
* **Performance Analysis:** Comparative view of revenue versus profit targets to identify underperforming regions.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Slicers for Year, Month, and Customer Type (E-commerce vs. Brick & Mortar) for granular data exploration.
